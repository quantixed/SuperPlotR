\title{Get summary statistics for SuperPlot data}
\usage{
get_sp_summary(df, meas, cond, repl, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing the experimental data}

\item{meas}{Character string specifying the name of the column containing
the measurements/values to summarize (e.g., "intensity", "speed")}

\item{cond}{Character string specifying the name of the column containing
the experimental conditions (e.g., "Treatment", "Genotype")}

\item{repl}{Character string specifying the name of the column containing
the replicate identifiers (e.g., "Replicate", "Experiment")}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (ignored)}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns for condition, replicate, rep_mean
(mean of measurements), and rep_median (median of measurements)
}
\description{
This function calculates summary statistics (mean and median) for each
combination of condition and replicate in a SuperPlot dataset.
}
\details{
It is useful to get teh summary data and computing further stats or making
plots. The function only needs 4 parameters, anything else is ignored. This
means you can simply exchange get_sp_summary() for your superplot() call and
get the correct data frame to work with.
}
\examples{
# Using the built-in dataset
get_sp_summary(lord_jcb, "Speed", "Treatment", "Replicate")

}
