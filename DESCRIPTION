Description: SuperPlots are a way to show experimental data in a way that
  communicates the individual variability as well as the experimental
  reproducibility. They were described in Lord et al. "SuperPlots, Communicating
  reproducibility and variability in cell biology". J. Cell Biol. (2020) 219(6)
