# Making non-SuperPlots - FlatPlots

SuperPlotR is designed to make SuperPlots, but sometimes you just want a simple
plot. This vignette will show you how to make a "FlatPlot" using SuperPlotR.

In contrast to SuperPlots, which emphasise the experimental replicates,
FlatPlots have a flat structure, where the replicates are not shown. They can
be used to look at data from a single experiment, or when the replicates are the
individual data points.

```{r flatplot}
library(SuperPlotR)
flatplot(lord_jcb, "Speed", "Treatment", ylab = "Speed (um/min)")
```

Many of the arguments are the same as for `superplot()`, but the `replicate`
argument is not used.

```{r flatplot2}
flatplot(lord_jcb, "Speed", "Treatment", ylab = "Speed (um/min)",
         colour = "rl_green")
```

The control of colour is usually by a single colour, which can be a hex code or
one of our lab's publication colour palette.

```{r flatplot3}
flatplot(lord_jcb, "Speed", "Treatment", ylab = "Speed (um/min)",
         colour = "rl_red", stats = TRUE)
```

It is also possible to specify a vector of colours, which will be used for each
condition. Any extra colours are ignored, and valid inputs are R colors, hex
codes or our lab's colour palette.

```{r flatplot4}
flatplot(lord_jcb, "Speed", "Treatment", ylab = "Speed (um/min)",
         colour = c("rl_red", "rl_blue", "rl_green"))
```

We can request statistical testing as for SuperPlots, but the p-values will be
calculated for the whole dataset, not for each replicate.

```{r flatplot5}
flatplot(lord_jcb, "Speed", "Treatment", ylab = "Speed (um/min)",
         colour = "rl_red", size = 4, alpha = 0.25,
         bars = "mean_ci")
```

In this example, we have increased the size of the points, made them slightly
more transparent, and added error bars to show the mean and 95% confidence
interval.
